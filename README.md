* Displays a menu containing the five commands Create, Calculate, View, About and Exit and enters the command number from the keyboard.
* If the user selects the Create command, the program creates a Students.dat file (in the current folder) and writes the five Student objects of the class to the file.
* If the user selects the View command, the program displays the contents of the Students.dat file on the screen.
* If the user selects the Exit command, the program exits.
* If the user selects the Calculate or About command, the program calls the calculate method of the Main class or the about method. The given methods do nothing.

# Task:
Modify the calculate and about methods so that they do the following:
* The calculate method must enter the student number from the keyboard (assume that the students are numbered from one) and modify the grades of the student given in the Students.dat file. Enter new grades from the keyboard. If a negative student number was entered or the number exceeds the number of students in the file, the program should output the message "no such student"
